A `List<Boolean>` implementation using an integer's binary digits to store booleans. List operations are designed to have virtually constant time complexity using bitwise operations.

- [BinaryList](src/BinaryList) - standard implementation, supports up to 32 booleans.
- [BinaryListPlus](src/BinaryListPlus) - an unfinished attempt at expanding capacity. use BitSet?
