A `List<Boolean>` implementation using an integer primitive in 2's complement to store booleans. Primary list operations are intended to have near-constant time complexity.

[BinaryList](src/BinaryList) - standard implementation, supports up to 32 booleans.\
[BinaryListPlus](src/BinaryListPlus) - an unfinished attempt at expanding capacity.
